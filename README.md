# Personal Website Template
 (Works best on desktop)
# I wanted to practice my CSS, JS and HTML skills by creating this website

I designed this website to have smooth transitions between pages, which I believe I achieved fairly well, the home button takes you back to the start of the page and the mail button doesn't currently do anything.

You can probably take this for your own if you wanted to (just contact me first)

Thanks!
